# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
Third project in the Udacity Nanodegree Program "Front End Developer".

## Instructions
This project required me to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App. I was given the HTLM and CSS files, for the reason that purpose of this project was to learn more about API, Node.js, Server <-> Client and JS.

Through this project I had to code the server.js and app.js from scratch.
The CSS and HTML code and comments are not mine.

1. Start upp server server.js

2. Access website through browser with localhost:port

3. Type in any zipcode in US and the client will fetch this from the OpenWeathMap API. The data will be sent to the server and then requested back to the client and dynamically update the UI with the temperatur of that zipcode.
